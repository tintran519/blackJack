BLACKJACK
=========
## Description
Welcome to the popular casino game of Blackjack! The objective of the game is to attain a hand with a greater score than the dealer's. Be careful, however, because a score of over 21 will 
be a **_"BUST"_** and is considered a loss! A **_"Blackjack"_** hand comes with a 
50% bonus winning and is achieved when either the player or dealer receives an exact value of 21.

## Technologies Used
A combination of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery was used to construct the game in the
Sublime Text Editor. Furthermore, an external source was used to append the 
images to each card; the 'Card Starter' repository can be found at the following
link: https://github.com/hews/card-starter.

## Getting Started
To access the game, simply follow the instructions below:
  * Go to github.com
  * clone [this](git@github.com:tintran519/blackJack.git) repo.
  * Open the index.html in a web browser (Google Chrome recommended for best performance).

## Next Steps
Due to time constraints, there are still a couple of features that could be
implemented/improved to maximize user experience:
  * Fixing bug issues that occasionally occurs with win/lose results after a hand is split
  * When splitting, provide an indicator for current hand
  * CSS modifications to allow compatibility with mobile devices
  * Responsiveness to various window sizes in browser
  * Incorporating selective icons for the user menu
  * Adding audio effects for menu selection and card deals
  * Allowing users to subtract funds from the betting pool
